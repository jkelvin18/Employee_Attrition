# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from the Kaggle.

In this challenge, it was proposed to predict which employees are most likely to leave their jobs.  

I have done exploratory data analysis using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn. As this is a classification problem, I used the decision tree classifier and logistic regression. The TensorFlow library was used to implement the neural network.
